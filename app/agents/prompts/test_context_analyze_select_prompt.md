Based on your analysis, answer below questions:
1. do we need more context: construct search API calls to get more context of the project. If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.
2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be tested. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY.
