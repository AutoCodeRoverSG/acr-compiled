Let's analyze collected context first.
If an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.
If an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:
1. What does this part of the code do?
2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?
3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?
